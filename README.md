# Overview of Web Page

The web page outlines the different technologies I will be using while taking part in the Code Institue's Full Stack Web Developer Course. 
I have broken the technologies into three different catagories or streams. The streams ouline the three main projects I will be completing 
while taking part in the course. 

## Stream One

The first web page is for the technologies I will be using in Stream One. The first technology is HTML5, or the backbone of the web. 
The second technology is CSS3. CSS3 is the styling element that goes hand in hand with HTML5. The third technology is JavaScript. JavaScript
is a core element of web design along with HTML5 and CSS3. JavaScript makes the web page interactive. Cloud9 is an integrated
development environment. Cloud9 gives the developer a workspace. Then we have Git. Git is a  version control system for tracking changes in 
computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. Lastly in Stream One we have Github. Github is where I will be
hosting my web pages online in an open source setting. 

## Stream Two

The stream two page focuses on the technologies I will be using in this stream. The first o those being python. Python is a high level
programming language that focuses on code reliability and expressing the web page in fewer lines of code. The next technology is Flask, which is
a micro web framework written in python. MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. MYSQL 
is an open-source relational database management system. MYSQL is an abbreviation for Structured Query Language. Then as in Strem one, 
we have Git. Git is a  version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. 
Lastly in Stream two, as in stream one, we have Github. Github is where I will be hosting my web pages online in an open source setting. 

## Stream Three

Stream Three is the culmination of all of the skills I have learned in the course and will be the most high level of all of the projects that
I will do while on the course. The first technology I will be using in stream three is Python, which is a high level
programming language that focuses on code reliability and expressing the web page in fewer lines of code. The next is Django, which is a free 
and open-source web framework, written in Python, which follows the model-view-template architectural pattern. Heroku is a cloud platform as a 
service supporting several programming languages that is used as a web application deployment model. Then as in previous streams, we have Git. 
Git is a  version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. As in previous 
streams, we have Github. Github is where I will be hosting my web pages online in an open source setting. MYSQL is an open-source relational database 
management system. MYSQL is an abbreviation for Structured Query Language.
